# Minishell Project

Minishell is a simple Unix-like command-line shell developed as a part of my CMSC 216 course at the University of Maryland. It aims to provide a basic set of shell functionalities, allowing users to interact with their computer through command-line inputs. 
## Features

- Basic command execution and handling.
- Support for various built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `exit`).
- Redirection of standard input and output (`>`, `<`).
- Basic error handling and signal management.

## Getting Started

You must use the command ./yargs.x command then the rest of the command line input to use it. 


### Prerequisites

- Unix-like operating system (Linux/macOS).
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any C compiler that supports the C11 standard.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control (optional but recommended).
